Listen to Pandora from outside the US. Thank's to TOR :]

How to:

1. install tor
2. cp torrc into your home to .torrc
3. set up your browser to use tor.pac as the automatic proxy configuration file. you might have to upload it to a server - depending on how stupid your browser is. you can use my file though: http://nntp.pl/tor.pac
4. start tor
5. open www.pandora.com

If it doesn't work the first time you probably will have to weed out blocked tor nodes in the .torrc file.

Pianobar
--------
To get pianobar working with this you will have to additionaly install a HTTP proxy (like polipo) as pianobar doesn't work with SOCKS proxies. (Torifying it doesn't seem to work)

KTHX!
